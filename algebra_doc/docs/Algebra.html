several basic algebraic structures (e.g., groups, rings, vector spaces) as
Idris datatypes (axioms fully enforced).</p>
<p>Mathematically, the idea of an algebraic structure is quite simple. Consider
(a) the set of integers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, (b) two of the most basic
functions on it, <span class="math inline">\(+: \mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{Z} \)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\cdot: \mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, and (c) two unique elements of it,
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. There are various obvious properties that universally
hold; e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x\cdot (y\cdot z) = (x\cdot y) \cdot z\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x+y= y+x\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x\cdot y = y \cdot x\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x+0 = x \cdot 1 = x \)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\exists~y\in \mathbb{Z} [ x+y = 0 ]\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x \cdot (y+z) = x \cdot y + x \cdot z\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>(Unquantified variables are implicitly quantified over the domain of
discourse, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>.) These properties are referred to,
respectively, as <strong>associativity</strong>, <strong>commutativity</strong>, <strong>identities</strong>,
<strong>additive inverses</strong>, and <strong>dsitributivity of (multiplication over
addition)</strong>. There are various things to note. Plenty of other sets satisfy
these laws; for example, the rational numbers, or the real numbers, or the
complex numbers. Note also that, say, the irrational numbers do <em>not</em>
satisfy these properties; <span class="math inline">\(pi + (1-\pi)\)</span> is rational, and so <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span>
isn't even a binary function over the irrationals! Finally, note the
asymmetry in the fourth law, an asymmetry not present in the others. This is
necessary, as the following property (referred to as <strong>multiplicative
inverses</strong>) does <em>not</em> hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\exists y \in \mathbb{Z} [ x \cdot y = 1 ]\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>While <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, for example, <em>does</em> have a multiplicative inverse among the
<em>rationals</em>, it doesn't when we restrict our attention to the integers. (In
fact, not even the rational numbers satisfy the above law, because <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>
does not have a multiplicative inverse. After modifying the law to account
for that special case, however, the rationals do satisfy it, while the
integers still don't.)</p>
<p>So, was the point of all this? All we did was consider some numbers that
everyone is familiar with and mention some elementary properties of them.
How does that lead to any interesting mathematical questions? Well, the key
idea, the crucial motivating question of abstract algebra, is the following:</p>
<p><strong><em>What happens when we go in the other direction?</em></strong></p>
<p>That is, what happens when we <em>start</em> with a list of properties, then ask
what sorts of things satisfy it? The answers to this question are more
diverse than you may expect. For example, in addition to the integers and
its extensions, other more esoteric sets satisfy the above laws. E.g., the
set of integers modulo five, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_5 = \left\{\overline{0},
\overline{1}, \overline{2}, \overline{3}, \overline{4}\right\}\)</span>. In the
set, to calculate the &quot;sum&quot; of two elements, we calculate their usual sum,
then take that modulo 5 (that is, the remainder when dividing by 5; the
modulo operation is essentially a generalization of the concept of even and
odd numbers to divisibilities other than by 2); similarly with the product.
Thus, for example, <span class="math inline">\(\overline{4} + \overline{3} = \overline{2}\)</span>. A
similar line of reasoning indicates that additive inverses exist---in
fact, so do multiplicative inverses, at least for non-<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> elements!
Observe:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\overline{1} \cdot \overline{1} = \overline{1}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\overline{2} \cdot \overline{3} = \overline{1}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\overline{3} \cdot \overline{2} = \overline{1}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\overline{4} \cdot \overline{4} = \overline{1}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>However, if we look at the integers modulo 6 (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_6\)</span>), we find
that multiplicative inverses do <em>not</em> always exist; only <span class="math inline">\(\overline{1}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\overline{-1} = \overline{5}\)</span> are invertible. (Try it!) In fact,
the integers modulo n, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_n\)</span>, satisfy the weakened (i.e.,
ignoring <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>) multiplicative inverse law if and only if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is
prime.</p>
<p>These do not exhaust the possibilities---not even close!---but it should
be enough to give a taste of what abstract algebra is all about. You start
with some set with defined operations (a pairing known as a &quot;structure&quot;)
that you are familiar with, you distill that structure down to its most
basic and fundamental properties, and then you look at what sorts of things
satisfy those properties and what those properties alone entail. This allows
you to generalize familiar structures to more abstract ideas---the
original motivating structure becomes just a special case of a more general
property, and seemingly disparate things suddenly become two special cases
of a more general idea.</p>
<p>Note that in the process of generalization, we choose to &quot;forget&quot; any
auxiliary properties of the motivating structure. That is, the set of
objects, the binary functions <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span>, and the privilleged
elements <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, are not necessarily numbers, addition,
multiplication, zero, or one (respectively)! They can be any mathematical
object (that is, any concept that can be precisely defined) satisfying the
list of properties above. In other words, they are <em>like</em> numbers with
respect to the most basic qualities of them, but they may in fact be
completely different!</p>
<p>Thus, using the axioms as a starting point, one can ask which properties are
entailed by them, and which properties will differ between different
implementations of the axioms. What are the necessary and sufficient
conditions for various additional facts? E.g., does it follow from the laws
above that every element has a unique factorization? Among the motivating
structure of the integers this was true (a fact known as the Fundamental
Theorem of Arithmetic); in general, though, it is false! The question then
becomes how to further classify the space of implementations---what's the
simplest way to divide those that do always admit a unique factorization and
those that don't? These are the kinds of questions that the framework of
algebraic structures allows you to ask.</p>
<p>The laws given above define a ring; that is, any set (with the two defined
binary operations over it, as well as the two distinguished elements (which
can be thought of as nullary operations for uniformity)) satisfying the
above list of properties is known as a <strong>ring</strong>. The laws are called the
<strong>ring axioms</strong>. <strong>Ring theory</strong> is the branch of math studying rings, how
they relate to each other (namely, via <strong>ring homomorphisms</strong>), and how they
relate to other mathematical objects. Rings are not the only algebraic
structure; there are many, many more, and this package defines a few of the
more important ones as Idris records, as well as some members of that type.
Each module contains in its documentation an overview of that algebraic
structure and some interesting properties of them that make them worth
studying.</p>
<p>To create a term of an algebraic structure's type, one must not only provide
the sets and operations with the proper signatures, but also provide proofs
of the axioms of that algebraic structure. To see how this works, you might
want to take a look at <code>Algebra.Group</code>.</p>
