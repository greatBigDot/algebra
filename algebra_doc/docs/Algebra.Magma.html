<p>A magma is more-or-less the simplest non-trivial example of a algebraic
structure. It is simply a set together with a lawless binary operation over
it. More formally, it is <em>any</em> pair
<span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{M} = (M:\mathscr{V}, * : M^2 \to M)\)</span>. It doesn't matter what
the function <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span> is. It can have any properties whatsoever; the only
reuirement is that it be a function of the specified type. That is, it must
be a total co-injective relation with domain <span class="math inline">\(M^2\)</span> and codomain <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>,
where by &quot;co-injective&quot; I mean that for every input, there is no more than
one output. Together with totality, which states that every input has at
least one output, this means that a function is a relation where every input
has exactly one output.</p>
<p>Magmas aren't especially interesting in and of themselves. Because there are
no magma axioms, just a type, there isn't much that can be said about magmas
in general. However, they give a useful way to talk about other algebraic
structures. A group, for example, is a magma satisfying certain laws. In
other words, talking in terms of magmas and related lawless algebraic
structures just gives us a more convenient way to talk about the signature
of the more interesting ones. (Of course, all of this leads naturally to
groups, semigroups, monoids, etc. being extensions of the <code>Magma</code>
record.)</p>
<p>That's not to say there's nothing interesting about magmas. There are
interesting combinatorial questions arising from freely generated magmas.
That is, consider a magma generated by three elements, <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c\)</span>. By
&quot;freely generated&quot;, we mean that there are no equalities except those
directly entailed by the axioms; since there aren't any axioms, there aren't
any (non-reflexive) equalities! E.g., in a freely generated magma, we know
that <span class="math inline">\((x*y)*z \neq x*(y*z)\)</span> for every <span class="math inline">\(x, y, z\)</span>. If they were
equal, it would still be a magma, but not a freely generated one. Now, for
the free magma with 3 generating elements, how many elements are there with
exactly <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> applications of the operation <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span>? Or more generally,
what if there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> generating elements? If you like combinatorics,
you might enjoy working these and related questions out---and, as usual,
there's a connection to the Catalan numbers.</p>
